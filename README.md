## Data

## Summary
In this Twitter sentiment analysis project, I examined people's opinions on Interest rates and Unemployment. 
The results showed that unemployment had a mostly negative sentiment, while interest rates had a positive sentiment. 
I also found that political stance appeared to have an influence on people's opinions on these topics. However, more work needs to be done in that respect.
In terms of modeling, logistic regression performed the best among the different ML models compared.‚Äù
